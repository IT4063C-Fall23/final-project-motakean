    "\n",
    "The effect that food insecurity has on students' academic performance and attendance is the issue. People who are food insecure, particularly kids and students, sometimes struggle to concentrate in school because of hunger and inadequate nutrition. Comprehending this issue is essential as it has the potential to impede academic achievements and sustain the poverty cycle. Students who are hungry are more likely to struggle with focus and behavior problems, miss school, and do worse academically. Our goal is to guarantee equal educational opportunities and enhance overall academic results by eliminating food insecurity among pupils."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Students' academic performance and attendance rates are adversely affected by food insecurity. It is anticipated that pupils who face food insecurity will do worse academically and have lower attendance rates than students who do not face food hardship.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Low family income, a lack of affordable, nutrient-dense food options, and insufficient social safety nets may be the main contributors to food insecurity among pupils in the target community.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. While the reach and efficacy of the current food assistance programs in the area schools may be improved, they may have a positive influence on addressing student food insecurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.There may be differences in the prevalence of food insecurity among pupils in the target location, with some demographic groups likely to have greater rates than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. It is anticipated that certain demographic characteristics, such as lower family income and larger households, will be linked to a higher risk of food insecurity in the student population."

    "1. Smith, A., & Johnson, E. (2022). Food Insecurity and Its Educational Impact: A Comprehensive Study:\n",
    "I've located a scholarly study on food insecurity and its impact on education by Smith and Johnson from 2022. For my project, this report provides invaluable background information and references. It might include important information that I can use into my study to clarify the connection between food insecurity and education.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Local School District Reports on Attendance and Academic Performance:\n",
    "Reports from the local school system are a goldmine of information for my project. These reports offer comprehensive data on academic achievement, student attendance, and potentially useful information on nearby school food assistance programs. This information is essential to my analysis because it helps me comprehend how food insecurity affects our community's students' academic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) - Food Security in the United States: Key Statistics & Graphics:\n",
    "The USDA's data on food security in the United States will give my project a broader context. This dataset contains key statistics and graphics related to food security nationally. I can use this national data to compare it with our local data, helping me understand how our community's food insecurity compares to broader trends.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Food Bank Association (2020) - Hunger and Education: The Link Between Hunger and Learning:\n",
    "The Food Bank Association's publication from 2020 offers insights into the connection between hunger and education. This source provides additional context and may include data showcasing the impact of hunger on learning. I'll utilize this information to strengthen my analysis and support my project's findings.\n"
